EXPT No : 7 DATE:28/11/23
AIM:
To simulate the Pre Processing for 3D printing. REQUIREMENTS:
System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM. PROCEDURE:
Pre-processing encompasses the steps between design and printing. Process of 3D printing starts with designing in CAD. Then printer software slices
3D CAD file into layers. For each slice, the software converts the data into
machine code that determines tool paths for the machine to follow. The various
steps in pre-processing from design to printing are as follows:
1) CAD File
2) Conversion to STL a. Orientation b. Support Structure c. Slicing d. Path
Planning
1. CAD File
Every manufacturing process starts with the process of designing and as in any
type of manufacturing, there are certain limitations to the materials and
manufacturing processes that dictate how the product should be designed, 3D
printing is no different. In 3d printing, characteristics of hardware, software,
temperature, filament and many other factors play an important role in how a
digital model translates into a printed object. Some of them are designed with a
strong base, grain direction, overhung, wall thickness, round corners and
tolerances. 2. Conversion to STL
In order to check the interface of the object and make it reliable to 3d printers, conversion to STL file is required. It also facilitates other features like quick error
check, bridging the gap between CAD platforms, exhibition purposes and 3D
digitizer extension. a. Orientation:
Orientation plays a vital role in the final product of 3d printing as it affects the part
accuracy, manufacturing time, strength and surface finish. There are various
orientations by which we can print the object such as vertically upward, vertically
downward and in horizontal plane.
b. Support Structure:
Support structures are required where the objects are unable to get printed
directly. Support structures help to guarantee the printability of a section during
the 3D printing measure and also it can assist with forestalling part twisting, secure a section to the printing bed and guarantee that parts are joined to the
fundamental body of the printed part. c. Slicing:
The motive behind slicing a 3D model is to transform the model into guidelines
for the 3D printer. To play out this errand, the slicing software isolates the item
into numerous layers. It's classified "slicing" since it "slices" the 3D model to
make numerous layers. After the layers have been made, the slicing software
applies different qualities to every one of them. d. Path Planning:
Path planning helps to improve the printed surface quality, shape accuracy and
infill distribution quality. There are various ways for path planning which can be
used to print the objects which may affect the following factors in objects like
raster path, grid path, spiral path and zigzag path.
● All the processes related to pre-processing will be shown on the screen. ● Select CAD file preparation from the visible list. ● When the first process is selected then it will open in the blank space in
the left side of the screen. ● Select the options of process of pre-processing in the sequence in which
they are shown. ● If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the
screen showing the name of the process to be selected. OUTPUT :
STEP 1 EXPLANATION:
CAD file:
A CAD (Computer-Aided Design) file is a digital representation of a physical object or system that is created using specialized software. In the context of pre-processing in various fields such as engineering, manufacturing, architecture, and simulation, a CAD file is crucial STEP 2 EXPLANATION: Conversion to STL: The STL file is a crucial component in the pre-processing stage for 3D printing because it provides a standardized, simplified, and compatible representation of 3D geometry that can be easily processed by slicing software and used by 3D printers to manufacture physical objects. STEP 3 EXPLANATION: Orientation: Orientation is a crucial step in pre- processing various types of data, including images and text. In the context of image processing, orientation involves aligning or standardizing the orientation of images to a common reference frame, which facilitates subsequent analysis and feature extraction. For instance, in computer vision applications, ensuring consistent
orientation of images helps algorithms detect patterns, objects, and structures more accurately.Overall, orientation in pre- processing is essential for optimizing the performance and reliability of subsequent data analysis and machine learning tasks. STEP 4 EXPLANATION: SUPPORT STRUCTURE: Support structures are crucial in pre- processing, particularly in 3D printing, to ensure the successful fabrication of complex and overhanging geometries. When printing an object layer by layer, certain designs may have sections that extend outward or have features that cannot be built upon without additional support.Support structures provide stability for overhangs, bridges, and intricate details, allowing the material to be deposited accurately and maintaining the structural integrity of the final product. STEP 5 EXPLANATION: Slicing: Slicing is a crucial step in the pre-processing phase of 3D printing as it involves dividing a three- dimensional digital model into individual, two-dimensional layers that can be sequentially
printed. This is essential
because 3D printers
operate layer by layer, depositing material to
gradually build up the
final object. STEP 6 EXPLANATION:
Path planing:
Path planning is crucial
in the pre-processing
stage of 3D printing as it
determines the optimal
route that the 3D printer
nozzle will follow to
create the desired object
layer by layer. Efficient
path planning is
essential for minimizing
print time, reducing
material waste, and
ensuring the structural
integrity of the final
product. Result: Thus the simulation on the Preprocessing in additive manufacturing is
completed.
